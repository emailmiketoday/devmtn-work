// Custom Directives
// Resuing parts of the UI 

// Check vocab whenever possible!


DIRECTIVE means to always, always, return an object.

Directives are fundamentally different from controller and services.  When you
create a controller or service, you are writing the part of the code that actually
does stuff.  

The object in directives are the set of instructions we tell Angular to do when someone
runs the directive.


Snake-Case = every word is separated by a hyphen.
The reason to use snake-case is because HTML is case INSENSITIVE, so it doesnt
care about cases/capital leters.  You have to use snake-case in HTMLAllCollection

Directive Names - Must be camelCase in the angular code/javascript.
