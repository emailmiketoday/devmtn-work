// Day 4 Notes 

SPA
// Single Page Application 

UI-Router
// A routing framework for AngularJS built by the AngularUI team.
// It allows you to change your application views based on the 
// STATE of the application, not just the route URL.


States vs URL Route
// Your views and routes aren't tied down to the site URL.

.config()
/* All of your */ STATES, ROUTING, AND VIEWS /* are handled within the config!
