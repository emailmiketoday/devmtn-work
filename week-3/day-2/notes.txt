Question: How to organize your code?

////////////////////////////////////////////

Angular Built In Services!

1. $http, $watch, $location, $log, $filter, $timeout, $scope

$watch service example, it is called a "Shallow Watch" only go the first level deep.
Below the code will automatically save/update anytime a change happens to the 'cars' array!

app.controller('myController', function($scope) {

	$scope.cars = [];
	
	$scope.watch('cars', function() {
		save();
-- Fires if the 1st level child changes.
	})
	
	$scope.watchCollection('cars', function() {
		save();
	}, true)
-- This one files if any descendant every changes in any way.


	$scope.watchCollection('cars', function() {
	});
-- Fires on - Add, remove, move, change, delete.

});
